# [Burger](https://evening-retreat-19942.herokuapp.com/)

This repository is related to [Sequelize Burger](https://github.com/rxtATX/SequelizeBurger) in that this was the original genesis of that project.

The codes within this repository are essentially attempting to accomplish the sames things, but instead of using the ORM Sequelize, it is a manual style of ORM where functions are imported and called in different areas.

A user can "cook" a burger, "eat" said burger, and then "throw away the wrapper". These methods practice: * Create * Put * Delete

# Installation

Pull down codes. Run NPM install. MySQL workbench is required to run in a local environment. Populate the database from within the browser.
